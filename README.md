# Portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio made to practice controlling HTML and CSS from scratch. This is a first concept idea with room for improvement as I learn more semantics and cool tricks.
## This project was made with:
-HTML
-CSS
## Covers:
-Basic html and css semantics.
-Functional anchors and flexbox.
-Positioning and hero control among other basic code control.
-Misses full responsiveness to other devices with css special conditions but it adpats to devices without breaking the code.
### Anchors:
-Navbar to sections.
-Projects to websites (on github) with a command for new tabs instead of redirecting current tab.
-Contacts to mail and social media redirecting current tab.
